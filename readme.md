Overview
This is a Telegram bot application designed for video file management and sharing. The bot provides functionality for uploading, storing, categorizing, and sharing video files through Telegram. It includes features like user analytics, favorites, download limits, and administrative controls. The project contains two different bot implementations - one using the python-telegram-bot library (bot.py) and another using pyTelegramBotAPI (main.py), with the main implementation being the video management bot.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Bot Framework Architecture
The system uses two different Telegram bot frameworks:

python-telegram-bot (PTB): Modern async framework used in bot.py for basic echo functionality
pyTelegramBotAPI (telebot): Synchronous framework used in main.py for the main video management bot
The main application (main.py) was chosen for its synchronous simplicity, making it easier to handle file operations and database transactions without complex async management.

Data Storage Solution
SQLite Database: Used for persistent storage with a custom schema
Local File Storage: Video files are stored using Telegram's file_id system
Database Schema: Includes tables for videos, user analytics, and user favorites with proper foreign key relationships
The SQLite choice provides simplicity for a single-instance bot while supporting complex queries for analytics and user management.

State Management
In-Memory User States: Dictionary-based conversation state tracking for multi-step user interactions
Session Management: Temporary state storage for upload processes and user preferences
Administrative Features
Role-Based Access: Hard-coded admin user ID with elevated permissions
Content Management: Admins can manage video metadata, categories, and user access
Analytics Tracking: User interaction logging for downloads, views, and favorites
Service Architecture
Keep-Alive Service: Flask-based HTTP server to maintain bot availability on hosting platforms
Threading: Separate thread for the keep-alive web server to run alongside the bot
Error Handling: Basic error logging and user feedback mechanisms
The architecture prioritizes simplicity and reliability over scalability, suitable for small to medium-scale video sharing communities.

External Dependencies
Core Libraries
python-telegram-bot: Modern async Telegram bot framework (used in bot.py example)
pyTelegramBotAPI (telebot): Synchronous Telegram bot API wrapper (main implementation)
SQLite3: Built-in Python database engine for data persistence
Hosting and Deployment
Flask: Lightweight web framework for keep-alive HTTP endpoint
Replit Environment: Designed to run on Replit with environment variable configuration
Threading: Python's built-in threading for concurrent web server operation
Configuration Dependencies
Environment Variables: BOT_TOKEN stored in Replit Secrets for secure token management
File System: Local file storage using Telegram's file handling system
Development Dependencies
Testing Framework: Extensive pytest-based test suite (visible in tests/ directory)
Code Quality: Pre-commit hooks and type checking infrastructure
Documentation: Sphinx-based documentation system
The dependency choices emphasize minimal external requirements while providing robust functionality for a video sharing bot.
